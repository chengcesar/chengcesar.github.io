# Project 03

A generative design system that uses AI to create optimal building layouts based on site constraints, program requirements, and sustainability goals.

## Overview

Traditional architectural design is time-intensive and often limited by human cognitive constraints. This system leverages machine learning to explore thousands of design variations, presenting architects with optimized solutions that balance multiple objectives.

## Key Features

- **Constraint-based Generation**: Input site boundaries, building codes, and program requirements
- **Multi-objective Optimization**: Balance daylight, energy efficiency, circulation, and cost
- **Iterative Refinement**: AI learns from architect feedback to improve suggestions
- **Export to CAD**: Generated designs export directly to Revit and Rhino

## Technology Stack

- AI/ML: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- Geometry: Rhino.Compute, Grasshopper
- Frontend: React, Three.js
- Backend: Python, Flask

## Results

Early adopters report 40% reduction in early design phase time and improved building performance metrics across all tested projects.

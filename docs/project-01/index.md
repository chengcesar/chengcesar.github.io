## Overview

This project explores shape grammars and population-based thinking through a series of computational design sketches that generate 2D geometric configurations. 

This work part of an ongoing exploration where I aim to reframe  **generative design** beyond optimization-driven paradigms. Rather than treating design as a search-optimization problem defined by fitness or objective functions, I am interested in more open-ended, stochastic processes that frame design as an exploration of possibility space. 

## Why Optimization Misses the Point

Most generative systems today rely on optimization: a fitness function, an objective, a definition of success. But optimization assumes something crucial—that we already know what we’re optimizing for. 

This exploration intentionally avoids fitness functions and predefined objectives. Instead of identifying optimal solutions, the system examines the generative capacity of rule-based grammars to produce diverse populations of forms. The focus shifts from individual outcomes to the structural and relational properties of the population as a whole —not problem solving but exploratory inquiry.

## Key Ideas Explored

- **Population Thinking (Ernst Mayr)** — Variation as a fundamental condition rather than deviation from an ideal
- **Pattern Thinking (Buckminster Fuller)** — Recurring structural patterns across scales and contexts
- **Potentiality vs. Actualization (Aristotle)** — Forms as carriers of latent capacities activated by context
- **Information Entropy (Claude Shannon)** — Diversity measured as informational richness; high-entropy populations preserve optionality and future relevance

## Method

Rule-based shape grammars generate diverse populations of geometric forms. No fitness functions or performance metrics are applied. The focus is on population structure, entropy, and emergent relevance rather than convergence.

## Closing Thoughts

This project proposes an alternative computational design mindset:

- from solutions to populations
- from performance to potential
- from form-making to condition-setting

It establishes a foundation for open-ended generative systems where relevance emerges through context rather than optimization.
